This is a simple project that I worked on in teamTreehouse that involved:

1) Accessing the teamTreehouse API to retrieve user Data by making a node https request
2) Parsing the JSON data
3) Displaying the data to the user in the command line.

Amongst other things, my own implementation of this project involves adding a readline to the project so that the user can input any username, checking the statusCode of the request and displaying messages to the user to let the user know what is going.

This was to practice using node in the console and become familiar with Node.js' API.
